# Group_Count-Elements

Project was:
- input: images with kinda lego blocks with holes in it.
1. Blocks are different colors and connected to each other. 
2. They were in groups. There were around 5-10 groups that consisted of f.e. 2 blue blocks, 1 red block, 1 yellow, 2 white, total count of round holes 30.
3. Background is white table from the top with light shining on it.
- output: json file that shows in specific order groups of blocks with amount of certain color blocks and overall amount of round holes in whole group.

Code was written without deep learning, only OpenCV.
Code has some variables written in Polish so might be hard to understand. Might be fixed in future if not focused on other projects.
